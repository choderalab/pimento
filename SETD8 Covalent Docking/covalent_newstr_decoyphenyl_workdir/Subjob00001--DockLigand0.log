REPORT OF BEST 76 POSES

The sorted ligand structures were written to the file
Subjob00001--DockLigand0_lib.maegz

Final rankings based on original docking score
0 poses were rejected by the energy filters,
    Coul+vdw Energy <=     0.0    Hbond Interaction <=     0.0    Metal Interaction <=    10.0    GlideScore <=   100.0
(If any of the above properties is not defined for a given pose,
the corresponding filter is not applied to that pose.)
