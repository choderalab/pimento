Conformational landscapes---projections onto the two slowest coordinates---show multiple heterogeneous conformational states observed in simulations at the \nobreakspace  {}$50 \mu s$ timescale. (c, d). Structural comparisons indicate conformational heterogeneity near the known SAM / sinefungin binding site. Ligand-bound crystal structures (pink, cyan) show similar conformational states. Panels a and c correspond to SETD2, while panels b and d correspond to NSD2. SETD2 bound to SAH (d: cyan) adopts a TYR-up orientation (PDB:4H12), while SETD2 bound to sinefungin (d: pink) adopts a TYR-down orientation (PDB:4HMU). NSD1 bound to SAM (e: pink) adopts a PHE-up conformation (PDB: 3OOI). In all three systems, simulations suggest the presence of both conformations in solution, suggesting that predictive models of binding affinity and selectivity will require careful accounting for the conformational preferences of the unbound protein. In particular, our models predict similar conformational states in NSD2, for which there is currently no crystal structure. }}{2}}
