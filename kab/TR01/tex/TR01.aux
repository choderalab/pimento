Conformational landscapes---projections onto the two slowest coordinates---show multiple heterogeneous conformational states observed in simulations at the $\approx 50 \mu s$ timescale. (c, d). Structural comparisons indicate conformational heterogeneity near the known SAM / sinefungin binding site. Ligand-bound crystal structures (gray, black) show similar conformational states. (c). SETD2 bound to SAH (black) adopts a TYR-up orientation (PDB:4H12), while SETD2 bound to sinefungin (gray) adopts a TYR-down orientation (PDB:4HMU); our simulation models (color) recapitulate the subtle conformational differences between these states. (d). Similar conformational heterogeneity is observed in models for NSD2 (color). Because no crystal structure is available for NSD2, NSD1 (with SAM bound) is shown for comparison (black). Simulations of SETD2 and NSD2 suggest that novel therapeutics might target and stabilize alternative near-native conformations, as has been observed in selective kinase inhibitors. }}{2}}
